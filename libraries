break, continue, pass in Python 
 
break – takes you out of the current loop.
 
continue – ends the current iteration in the loop and moves to the next iteration.
 
pass – The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required. syntactically but the program requires no action. It is commonly used for creating minimal classes.






map, filter, lambda
 
map – The map() function applies a function to every member of iterable and returns the result. If there are multiple arguments, map() returns a list consisting of tuples containing the corresponding items from all iterables.
 
filter – It takes a function returning True or False and applies it to a sequence, returning a list of only those members of the sequence for which the function returned True.
 
lambda- Python provides the ability to create a simple (no statements allowed internally) anonymous inline function called lambda function. Using lambda and map you can have two for loops in one line.



A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. Python’s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.





LIST
L = [1, "a" , "string" , 1+2] 
But the most powerful thing is that list need not be always homogenous. A single list can contain strings, integers, as well as objects. Lists can also be used for implementing stacks and queues. Lists are mutable, i.e., they can be altered once declared.



TUPLE
tup = (1, "a", "string", 1+2) 
A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are just like lists with the exception that tuples cannot be changed once declared. Tuples are usually faster than lists.



# Create a new DICTIONARY  
d = dict() # or d = {} 
  
# Add a key - value pairs to dictionary 
d['xyz'] = 123
d['abc'] = 345
  
# print the whole dictionary 
print d
