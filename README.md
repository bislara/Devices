# MOS Simulator Tool 

This is a tool to simulate the MOS electrostatics. It includes the simulation of  2 terminal, 3 terminal and 4 terminal MOSFET. Everything is done for both nMOS and pMOS. This tool is designed to give users an interactive visual representation of how a MOSFET would work under different scenarios by asking for input from the user and plotting the resulting graphs. It will be very useful for research purpose in Semiconductor Devices. It will give a perfect idea of the operation of the MOSFET and how it works in different conditions. <br>
Below is the link of the tool uploaded on nanoHUB community, which is a online platform to simulate using the different tools.<br>

## Prerequisites
Download the following packages for before using the tool
```bash
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install sympy
pip install subprocess.run
pip install csv
```


## Getting Started

Clone or download the repository and run the final_file.py to run the tool. You will get a homepage which has buttons for different types of MOS. <br><br>

Click on one of them to open another window. One of the window is shown below :- <br><br>

We can vary the shown parameter values by moving the sliders. Proper legends and labelling are also there for better information. The value of the slider in shown beside the slider bar. Also there is option for saving the graphs in matplotlib.<br>
There is a ADD button at the bottom right of the window. Clicking on that
button, adds 4 extra graphs on the window and now you can change the slider
to change the 4 graphs and can be used to compare the different graphs. <br><br>

## Future development in the project

➢ Well, this project can be extended more by plotting the graphs in the
accumulation region also.<br>
➢ The GUI can be more improved and attractive.
<br>➢Better algorithm can be used to make the simulation more faster.<br>
➢ The tool can also be extended to plot more graphs and making it
more interactive for the user.<br>
➢ One can add more features like saving the data points in an excel
sheet<br>
➢ Feature to save the parameters used while saving the data points.<br>
